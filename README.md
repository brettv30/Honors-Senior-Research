# Honors-Senior-Research

Here's a repository containing my R project that I worked on for my CSC 498 course "Honors Senior Research".
The goal of this course is to augment hands-on Artificial Intelligence programming and build upon the analytics skills I learned in the classroom in my CSC 260 course "Analysis of Algorithms". The work I completed in that course can be found here: https://github.com/brettv30/Analysis-of-Algorithms.

Initially we began with datasets containing National Crime Rate and State Crime Rate data. These can be found in the "Section 1 Data" folder. We retreived these datasets from the FBI Crime Stats website which can be semi-recreated from here: https://ucrdatatool.gov/Search/Crime/Crime.cfm. 

The script file is broken up into a total of 8 different sections. Each one indicating a different milestone in this class. 

# Section 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
  - Here we preformed extensive EDA specifically looking at correlations between the crimes in each individual state. Through this analysis we learned that the data is not normally distributed and that it is futile to try to make assumptions about the entire population when looking at one state's crimes.  

# Section 2: Regional Correlations, Clustering, and Median Household Income
  - Here we split that data into regions according to the split here: https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/maps/reference/us_regdiv.pdf and we included Median Household Income data for the entire nation as well as for each state. This information was obtained from here: https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2019/acs/acsbr18-01.pdf.
